    text: '<p>The goal of a strategy session is to understand what a product or service does and distilling it into a clear story so that the customer can understand it''s value. We all have different ideas about how the story should be told so we are going to align them by working together, seeing where the conflicts are and solving them.</p><p>If we don’t do this and present a solution when not everybody is aligned on what we’re trying to achieve, what story we''re trying to communicate. The discussion going to end up being “I like this” or “I don’t like this” rather than is this solving our problem the way we’re all aligned too.</p><p>I facilitated this session for our group, I''ll go through the different parts and shed some light on our process.</p><h2>Concept</h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Onliness statement<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Target audience<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Features &amp; benefits<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Messages &amp; objectives<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Facts<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Recap<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Conclusion<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p><h2>Reflection<br></h2><p>TODO: What did we do here</p>'
