    text: '<p>The Team Up app has a lot of different states. When I talk about state I mean the data the components depend on and render such as users and groups for example.</p><p>Managing the state of an application full of components can be difficult, thatâ€™s why I use Vuex. Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue. Instead of communicating event up and passing props down Vuex lets me consolidate the entire state of the app in one store, a single source of truth.&nbsp;</p><p>When using a single state tree, the entire state of the app is contained inside one big object. However, as the app grows in scale, the store can get really bloated.</p><p>Vuex allows me to divide the store into modules. Each module can contain its own state and functionality which makes my code more manageable.&nbsp;</p><p>To make the modules even more self-contained I use namespaces to avoid conflicts. This means I could use the same variable or function name in different modules.</p>'

Goed dat je namespaces gebruikt, dat zorgt voor een extra afkadering die je ook bij the module pattern in vanilla JS hebt.<br></p><h2>Reflection</h2><p>Vuex and modules help me deal with state management at the costs of more boilerplate. It''s a bit more work upfront but in the long run, when the codebase has scaled, I''ll be more productive. It''s definitely something I want to make a habit of using.</p>'
