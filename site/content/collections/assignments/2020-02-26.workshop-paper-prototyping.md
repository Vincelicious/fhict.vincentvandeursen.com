    text: '<h2>Reflection</h2><p>I''m a perfectionist and more often then not this causes me to spend too much time on the details. With a paper prototype I don''t have to. It helped me to quickly get some ideas out of my head and more and discuss them. This is valuable for the next iteration, a low-fidelity prototype.</p>'
