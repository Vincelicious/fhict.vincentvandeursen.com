    text: '<p>I explored different directions in how the Team Up user interface could be designed. For one such direction I choose to follow the iOS interface guidelines because a large part of the target audience uses iPhones. These guidelines are regarding to layout, typography, color palette, navigation bar and search bar.</p>'

    text: '<p>First I looked at the layout to ensure the UI doesn''t get clipped and the default font, which is San Fransisco (SF). Next, I looked at the colors I should use. Because I was making a light themed version these were mostly grays.</p>'

      <p>With the basics in place I could start adding elements such as the navigation bar. It shows the title of the current view because it helps people understand what they're looking at. I used a large title because I want to provide extra emphasis on the context. Large titles should never compete with content, but in some apps, the 
      big, bold text of a large title can help orient people as they browse 
      and search.</p><p>I also added a search bar that allows people to search through a large collection of values by typing text into a field. A search bar can be displayed alone, or in a navigation bar or content view. Finally, I added the content itself.</p><p>By following the iOS interface guidelines the users who are already daily using an iPhone, which a large part of our target audience does, will understand the app more intuitively.</p><p>After that I made a second iteration that followed the guidelines for a dark themed interface. The changes mostly consisted out of switching the light colors to darker ones and adding an accent color. A dark themed interface reduces eye strain and saves battery.</p>

    text: '<p>With this iteration I wanted to emphasise a healthy appearance by using pastel colors and more white space. I still followed a few guidelines from iOS with regard to the navigation bar because it makes the interface more familiar and intuitive for the end user.</p><p>I also followed a few design principles described in the book <a href="https://refactoringui.com/book/" target="_blank">Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan</a>&nbsp;about color, typography and layout.</p>'

    text: '<h2>Reflection</h2><p>I think this was a good exercise to flex my design muscles. iOS interface guidelines have been tried and tested extensively so they are something to hold on to when in doubt. They ensure the interface is optimised for the user. They are definitely something I''m going to keep in mind when designing my next interface. But as I said earlier, they are just guidelines and sometimes a unique solution requires a unique design.</p>'
