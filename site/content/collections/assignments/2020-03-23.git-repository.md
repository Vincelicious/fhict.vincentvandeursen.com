    text: '<p>To collaborate on the same codebase we use Git and host it on <a href="https://github.com/Vincelicious/teamup" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. When someone starts implementing a new feature or user story they create a new branch so that they can make changes in an isolated environment. This ensures there are no conflicts while developing.&nbsp;</p><p>When they''ve finished implementing the feature or user story they need to merge it with the development branch so that the codebase is on the latests version. To merge a branch they need to make a pull request, I manage who has access to this codebase and review pull requests in order to ensure the quality of the code is up to standard. When the code is reviewed and passes the checks it will be merged.</p>'
